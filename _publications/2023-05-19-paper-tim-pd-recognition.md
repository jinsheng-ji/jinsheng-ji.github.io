Ultrahigh frequency (UHF) partial discharge (PD) detection is essential for routine maintenance of gas-insulated switchgear (GIS). Realizing low-noise detection with cost-effectiveness and ease of installation is promising but challenging. This article presents a novel broadband noise-shaping network (BNSN) integrated with a printed monopole antenna (PMA) sensor to realize sufficient noise rejection and good impedance matching. Moreover, by analyzing the equivalent noise circuit and co-designing a high-speed preamplifier circuit with the proposed sensor, the detection sensitivity and anti-interference of the proposed sensor module are improved. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed sensor are first verified in accordance with IEC 62478, followed by validations using a PD simulator and a real 24-kV GIS. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed sensor module has the capability to identify different PD types even in noisy environments.
