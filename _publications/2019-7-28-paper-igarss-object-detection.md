Aircraft detection from high resolution remote sensing image is a challenging task due to the lack of annotation information, large-scale image size, and sparse distribution of aircraft. Recently, some convolutional neural network(CNN) based methods explore the attention based weakly supervised way to localize the aircraft without manual annotation information. However, the detection results are not satisfied with high false detection ratio. In this paper, a method of utilizing weakly supervised attention model to localize the multi-scale aircrafts is presented, in which the attention model is carried out in a weakly supervised way. Compared with other CNN based method, the proposed attention model can obtain more accurate attention map and localize the aircrafts more precisely. The experimental results on two challenging datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves higher detection accuracy and lower false detection ratio than other methods.
