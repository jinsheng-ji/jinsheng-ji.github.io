Fine-grained images categorization is a challenging task due to the difficulty of recognizing the subtle difference among the sub-categories. Existing approaches mainly focus on using the manual annotations or the attention algorithm to localize the discriminative regions and have achieved impressive performance. But many methods regard these multi-scale regions equally even they may contain only one small part of the object. This may decrease the performance of the network. To address the problem, we propose the two-level attention network to generate object-level and part-level regions by a CNN model which has been fine-tuned by the full-size image train set of current task. We also train two subnetworks which combine these two-level features together and achieve better performance than two individual networks. The method consists of two parts: the first part is the attention network which localizes the area of the target in the image and its discriminative regions; the second part is the classification network which learns the two-level feature representations. We conduct experiments on the CUB-200-2011, Stanford Dogs, Stanford Cars and FGVC-Aircraft dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
