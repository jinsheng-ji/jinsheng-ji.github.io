Partial discharge (PD) is an essential indication of insulation degradation in high-voltage power equipment like gas-insulated switchgears (GIS). However, in certain applications that are exposed to intense external noise, traditional PD detection methods often encounter numerous challenges due to their vulnerability to noise and interference. This paper proposes a low-noise ultra-high frequency (UHF) sensing system for PD detection and classification. In analog front end, the noise performance is optimized using a broadband noise-shaping network (BNSN) integrated with a wideband printed monopole antenna (PMA). In digital back end, the combination of noise cancellation, wavelet time scattering (WTS) based features extraction and a support vector machine (SVM), yields 95% correct classification. Simulation and Comparative experimental results validate superior noise performance, effectiveness and accuracy of this UHF sensing system.
