Developing an effective and precise partial discharge (PD) monitoring system for switchgear has garnered considerable attentions in recent times. The task of detecting and recognizing PDs using a portable PD detector presents notable obstacles due to the inevitable presence of noise interference and the striking similarities among different PD signals in field conditions. In this study, we propose a novel approach that integrates knowledge distillation and multi-task learning to effectively transfer the rich knowledge acquired by a sophisticated network to a more lightweight student network, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of PD recognition. Particularly, we propose an innovative equivalent frequency energy-based sampling approach to represent the acquired pulse waveforms. These signals are then subjected to clustering using a k-means model, effectively distinguishing PDs from noise. The Phase Resolved Partial Discharge (PRPD) patterns of each clustered signals are used to train our PD classification network. Leveraging the knowledge distillation and multi-task learning modules, our PD classification model surpasses the performance of the baseline model in both speed and accuracy. We executed ablation studies to comprehensively assess each proposed module within our experiments. Additionally, we conducted a comparative analysis against other methodologies on our constructed PD recognition dataset, showing the superior capabilities of the proposed approach.
