Hi, I am Jinsheng Ji. I received the Ph.D. and M.Eng. degrees in control science and engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2015 and 2021 respectively, China. The B.Sc. degree in automation is obtained from Nanjing Agricultural University in 2012, China. My research focuses on edge-computing AI, federated leanring, fault diagnosis and image processing.
